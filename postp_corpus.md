Listing all the postpositions from the literature and their attribute values. 
A value of 1 indicates that the given postposition always produces the typical behaviour of postpositions in the syntactic structure under examination. 
Columns:
- *pos*: the preferred ordering of the postposition and its complement regardless of their adjacency. 
- *zero*: the ***case-marking*** of the complement. 
- *adj*: delineates the strict adjacency of the two words. 
- *wh* represents the word's behaviour in wh-questions. Does the postposition always follow the wh-word, or can it stay behind? 
- *dem*: details the structure with a demonstrative pronoun. Is the postposition copied onto the demonstrative as well,
or is only the case marker copied? 
- *pers pron*: specifies the structure with a personal pronoun. When postpositions take a pronominal complement, where does the agreement marker appear? 
On the postposition itself, or on another element?

A question mark indicates that I am not entirely certain in the acceptability of my examples for testing the given property. 
A '-' marks that the given postposition does not appear in the given construction (with a personal pronoun, for example)


Here I sum up the teatures and their binary values used when evaluating the behaviour of postpositions in the corpus. 
P stands for postposition.
|**Column**| **the feature**| **if 1** |**if 0** |
|---|---|---|---|
|pos | position of P relative to the noun | P always follows the noun | P may appear before and after the noun|
|zero  | the case of the noun |always caseless noun |P takes a noun with a lexical case | 
|adj  | the adjacency of the two words  | noun and P always next to each other  | other words may appear between P and the noun |
|wh  | the behaviour of P in wh-questions  | P follows the wh-word  | P stays behind |
|dem|P's behaviour with demonstrative pronouns|P is copied onto the demonstrative |P is not copied onto the demonstrative|
|pers pron |person-number agreement with a personal pronoun|person-number agreement appears on P |person-number agreement not on P |
